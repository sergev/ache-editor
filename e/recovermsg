The last time you used the editor in this directory, you crashed or aborted.
You have these choices:

  1. LE will silently recover the last session and then update the screen;
     then you should exit before you continue editing.
       (Normally, select this option.)

  2. LE will replay the last session on the screen;  you should exit before
     you continue editing.
       (Select this option if LE continues to crash in response to Option 1;
       press the interrupt key just before LE completes the replay.  The
       interrupt key on the LE standard keyboard is CTRL/C.

  3. LE will ignore the crashed or aborted session and forget ahead as per the
       arguments with which it was invoked.
       (Select this option only if you do NOT wish to recover the last
       session's work.)

  4. LE will return you to the shell, having done nothing.
       (Select this option if you do not know what to do and need assistance
       from your system administrators.)
